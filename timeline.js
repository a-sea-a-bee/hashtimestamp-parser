Tips for timestamping

1. I start by typing a single period "." to placehold and so discord will note the time. (please be aware discord times are always in your time zone not PDT, but the woke stream will have a PDT clock)
2. I follow that up with a quick edit of a description. (you can skip step one if you know what happened, or if it short)
3. Repeat 1 and 2 as the event unfolds. 
4. When there is a calm moment I add the Day XX 00:00 PDT - CITY - and make a better description if needed
5. The most important part be watching the folks in #stream-chat who are gathering links of the event. This is super important as the twitter/YouTube links don't tend to disappear and can always be referred back too. It also allows people to easily review the night. 
6. MEE6 will limit you to 3 twitter links on one post, but you can get around this by adding a few more placeholders for major events.
7. Don't have 3 people make stamps for the same event and try to stay in chronological order
